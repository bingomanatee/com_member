com_member
==========

A nuby-express component for managing membership.

It presents a login system with optional oAuth integration, and a basic signin system, and providing granular ACL.

Note on terminology - a "member" is a registered user of this site. where "user" is used it refers to data from an oAuth system.

Currently only Facebook is integrated into the registration system, with Twitter coming in the near future.
